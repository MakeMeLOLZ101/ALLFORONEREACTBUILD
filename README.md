# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Checking Each Page

- Madlib seems incredibly short. I am confused why you don't have at least 10
- All others seem fine
- I think you should have some sort of background. Even a color background instead of a bright white would have been good.

### Desktop

- everything appears fine when I try adjusting on random pages

### Tablet

- Back to Menu button overlaps with the madlib submit button

### Mobile

- Font is a little too large for the text boxes
- Mad Lib submission button is being covered by Back to Menu
- Back to Menu button seems to cover a lot of things in other pages too
